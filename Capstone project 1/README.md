### Cervical cancer risk prediction and identification of key risk factors

This project will examine data collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela. 
The dataset comprises demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of patients.

#### Introduction

Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and
the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000
cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000 deaths.This is about 8% of the total cases and
total deaths from cancer. About 70% of cervical cancers occur in developing countries.

#### Problem statement 

Despite the possibility of prevention with regular cytological screening,
cervical cancer remains a significant cause of mortality in low-income countries. As in many
other diseases, there are several screening and diagnosis methods. For instance, in the
detection of precancerous cervical lesions, screening strategies include cytology, colposcopy
and biopsy. In developing countries resources are very limited and patients usually have poor
adherence to routine screening due to low problem awareness. Consequently, the prediction of
the individual patient’s risk and the best screening strategy during her diagnosis becomes a
fundamental problem. Most of these screening methods highly depend on the physician
expertise and subjective comfort on the decision process, being a key aspect to improve data
acquisition using the physician preferences. Identification of key risk factors would improve the
collection of necessary patient data and, on their basis, determine whether the patient needs an
additional examination.
